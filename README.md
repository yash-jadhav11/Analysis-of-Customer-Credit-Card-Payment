# Analysis of Customer Credit Card Payment: Identifying Factors for Credibility Assessment

## Introduction:
This project focuses on analyzing customer credit card payment data to identify factors influencing credibility assessment. Rigorous data cleaning procedures were performed using Python libraries such as pandas to ensure data integrity and reliability for subsequent analysis and visualization tasks.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to identify key factors affecting the credibility assessment of customers based on their credit card payment behavior.

## Data Cleaning Procedures:
- Utilized Python libraries such as pandas to perform comprehensive data cleaning.
- Addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers to ensure data integrity.
- Conducted data validation checks to maintain data reliability.

## Analysis and Visualization:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the structure and distribution of the credit card payment data.
- Visualized patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data using matplotlib and seabornÂ libraries.
